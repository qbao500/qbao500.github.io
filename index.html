										I'm a third-year Game Development student at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences (KAMK) in Finland.
										I'm currently looking for internship opportunities (Spring semester 2021), not only to apply my skills to more practical works, but also to develop them and acquire more experience. 
										<br><br>
										Contact working is preferable for me since it offers more effective communication. 
										Therefore, I'm willing to relocate if needed.
										However, I'm still able to work remotely, if urgent social distancing is required.

										I have sufficient experience with both Unity and Unreal Engine.
										However, I'm more confident and proficient in Unity with C#, rather than Unreal in which I use more Blueprint than C++ for my projects.
										In terms of Unity, I found that Object Pooling and Scriptable Objects are really helpful, and I'm looking forward to learning more useful patterns and systems.  
										<br><br>
										For both engines, I have worked with game mechanics, UI, sound, animation, save/load system, performance optimization, and some of materials. 
										I have also been utilizing Git for version control for my teams' projects.

										I have a tendency to produce clean and reusable code, whenever possible. 
										About my personality, I would say I'm a calm and patient person, who also hard-working and eager to learn something new, especially technologies and techniques.
										I have quite a simple mind, but tend to look at different aspects and open to opinions from other people, in order to solve more complex problems. 
										<br><br>
										Besides playing games with friends to have fun, I like playing football and table tennis as well. 
										Moreover, I love taking pictures with wonderful landscapes that catch my eye, they just offer me some peace of mind.
										Some of the images here are a small part of the photos I've been shooting in Finland (not the first one).

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>
								I have worked on several projects with cross-discipline teams, including Artists, Designers and Producers.
								Although most of my teammates are Finns, I'm finding myself comfortable when talking to them, as well as supporting each other when necessary.

									<h3>Mercenape</h3>
									<p>
										A Unity project that my team (7 people) has been working on since Autumn semester 2020, and it will temporarily finish at the end of December.
										We are planning to continue with this game next year Summer, mostly to improve and polish every aspect, and after that Steam publishment.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this project, I am responsible for developing and testing enemy behaviors and character’s attack based on the design. 
										I also implemented waves spawning patterns for them, as well as import and integrate their 3D models and animations.
										In addition, I implemented Object Pooling and save-slot system into the game. 
										For aesthetic elements, I created some special effects with Unity Shader Graph to share with artists some works.

									<h3>Sortify - Go Green</h3>
									<p>
										A 3D casual game that our team (6 people) developed for Game Development studies in Spring semester 2020. 
										As the only main Programmer, I built and developed whole gameplay mechanics and game logic with Blueprint in Unreal Engine. 
										I also supported Artists with exporting and importing 3D models and animations, and created reusable codes for Designer to design each level. 
										Finally, I collaborated with our Producer to publish Sortify on Google Play Store, from Internal Testing to official Production publishment.

									<h3>Spinner Rush</h3>
									<p>
										This is my first game project ever (Autumn 2019), also my first time working with a game engine, specifically Unreal Engine.
										Although it took me some time to get familiar with and overcome problems, I was able to developed winning and losing conditions with C++.
										In addition, the visual scripting Blueprint really helped me to understand the workflow of the engine and its code. 
										Therefore, I could implement Sound and SFX to the game, as well as build save systems for them and player's progress for our project (5 people).

									<h3>Combat - Atari 2600 (2019)</h3>
									<p>
										This is actually an assignment in my Game Design course, in which the task is to replicate a very old game and "upgrade" it. 
										I found this <b><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_213-Atari2600.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a></b> on Retro Games page, which was made in 1977.
										It is a local multiplayer game that 2 players try to kill each other and compete who has more kills. 
										<br><br>
										The interesting thing for me is the ability to control the bullet while it's flying, although it's pretty hard and conflicting with your movement. 
										However, it makes the game really fun and also requires some skill to be able to defeat the opponent.
										Thus, I replicated it similarly, and also implemented "teleport" mechanic, that allows player to teleport to the bullet.
										<br><br>
										The game has no proper UI or sound, and no publishment, since I just developed it when I have freetime, until the deadline.
										However, a playtest was conducted and I found most of testers were enjoyable when playing an old-school local multiplayer game.
										I can feel the potential of this project and hopefully, I will able to continue developing this when the era of local multiplayer is back with new technologies.
