										I'm a third-year Game Development student at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences (KAMK) in Finland.
										I'm currently applying for Summer Job / Traineeship / Internship opportunities, not only to apply my skills to more practical works, but also to develop them and acquire more experience. 
										<br><br>
										Contact working is preferable for me since it offers more effective communication. 
										Therefore, I'm willing to relocate anywhere in Finland.

										I have sufficient experience with both Unity and Unreal Engine.
										However, I'm more confident and proficient in Unity with C#, rather than Unreal in which I use more Blueprint than C++ for my projects.
										In terms of Unity, I found that and Scriptable Objects are really helpful, and I'm looking forward to learning more useful patterns and systems.  
										<br><br>
										For both engines, I have been working with game mechanics, UI, sound, animation, save/load system, performance optimization, and some of materials. 
										About version control, I'm utilizing Git for the teams' projects.

										I have a tendency to produce clean and reusable codes, whenever possible. 
										More generally, I would say I'm a calm and patient person, who also hard-working and eager to learn something new, especially technologies and programming techniques.
										I have quite a simple mind, but tend to look at different aspects and open to opinions from other people, in order to solve more complex problems. 
										<br><br>
										Besides playing games with friends to have fun, I like playing football and table tennis as well. 
										Moreover, I love taking pictures with wonderful landscapes that catch my eye, they just offer me some peace of mind.
										Some of the images here are a small part of the photos I've been shooting in Finland (not the top one).

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>
								I have worked on several projects with cross-discipline teams, including other Programmers, Artists, Designers, and Producers.
								In addition, I also collaborated with some intercultural teammates, and I'm finding myself comfortable when talking to them, as well as supporting each other when necessary.

										A Unity project that my team (7 people) was working on till last December, although it's not completed yet.
										We are planning to continue with this game someday, mostly to improve and polish every aspect, and after that Steam publishment if possible.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this project, I am responsible for developing and testing enemy behaviors and character’s attack based on the design. 
										I also implemented waves spawning patterns for them, as well as import and integrate their 3D models and animations.
										In addition, I implemented Object Pooling and save-slot system into the game. 
										For aesthetic elements, I created some special effects with Unity Shader Graph to share with artists some works.

									<p>
										A 3D casual game that our team (6 people) developed for Game Development studies. 
										As the only main Programmer, I built and developed whole gameplay mechanics as well as game logics. 
										I also supported Artists with exporting and importing 3D models and animations, and created reusable codes for Designer to design each level. 
										Finally, I technically collaborated with our Producer to publish Sortify on Google Play Store, from Internal Testing to official Production publishment.

									<p>
										This is my first game project ever, also my first time working with a game engine, specifically Unreal Engine.
										Although it took me some time to get familiar with and overcome problems, I was able to developed winning and losing conditions with C++.
										In addition, the visual scripting Blueprint really helped me to understand the workflow of the engine and its code. 
										Therefore, I could implement Sound and SFX to the game, as well as build save systems for them and player's progress for our project (5 people).

									<h3>Combat - Atari 2600 (2019)<span style="float: right;font-size: 0.9em;">Unreal Engine</span></h3>
									<h4>02/2020<span style="float: right;">Blueprint</span></h4>
									<p>
										An assignment in a Game Design course, in which the task is to replicate a very old game and "upgrade" it. 
										I found this <b><a href="https://bit.ly/39YEplM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a></b> on Retro Games page, which was made in 1977.
										It is a local multiplayer game that 2 players try to kill each other and compete who has more kills to win. 
										<br><br>
										The interesting mechanic for me is the ability to control the bullet while it's flying, although it's pretty hard and partly conflicting with the movement. 
										However, it makes the game really fun and also requires some skill to be able to defeat the opponent.
										Thus, I replicated it similarly, and also implemented "teleport" mechanic, that allows the tank to teleport to its bullet.
										<br><br>
										This is just a demo, no proper UI or sound, since I just developed it when I have freetime, until the deadline.
										However, a playtest was conducted, and I found most of testers were enjoyable when playing an old-school local multiplayer game against each other.
										I can feel the potential of this project and hopefully, I will able to continue developing this when the era of local multiplayer is back with new technologies, along with extra flavors.

									<h3>Penguin - Unity ML<span style="float: right;font-size: 0.9em;">Unity</span></h3>
									<h4>05/2020<span style="float: right;">C#</span></h4>
									<p>
										It's actually a <b><a href="https://bit.ly/3qHtmnG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a></b> that I followed to learn Unity Machine Learning.
										The author utilizes Reinforcement Learning to train the Penguin, making it find the fish and avoid bones, then feed the hungry baby.
										<br><br>
										My attempt was letting the Penguin pick both fish and bones, but it has to bring them to the right place. The fish goes to the baby and the bones should be in a nearby trash bin.
										Unsurprisingly, the training was pretty much longer than it used to be, as it's hard for the Penguin to differentiate them.
										<br><br>
										Although I was not doing from stratch, I learnt some basic knowledge of Unity ML. It was also an useful and interesting experience to observe your "kids" getting smarter and better.
										In short, nothing goes wrong when studying Machine Learning, and I hope I can practically learn more about it.
