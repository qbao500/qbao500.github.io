									<p>
										I'm applying for Summer Job / Traineeship / Internship opportunities for Summer 2021, in order to contribute to building and bringing more advanced and enjoyable games to players.
										<br><br>
										During that period, I would love to develop my skills, acquire more experience, and get the best out of the hired working environment.
										Consequently, I commit myself to the continuation of a long-term growth with the game company, after graduation (by the end of 2021).    
										<br><br>
										Contact working is preferable for me since it offers more effective communication. 
										Therefore, I'm willing to relocate anywhere in Finland.

										I have sufficient experience with both Unity and Unreal Engine.
										However, I'm more confident and proficient in Unity with C#, rather than Unreal in which I use more Blueprint than C++ for my projects.
										In terms of Unity, I found that and Scriptable Objects are really helpful, and I'm looking forward to learning more useful patterns and systems.  
										<br><br>
										For both engines, I have been working with game mechanics, UI, sound, animation, save/load system, performance optimization, and some of materials. 
										About version control, I'm utilizing Git for the projects.

										I have a tendency to produce clean and reusable codes, whenever possible. 
										More generally, I would say I'm a calm and patient person, who also hard-working and eager to learn something new, especially technologies and programming techniques.
										I have quite a simple mind, but tend to look at different aspects and open to opinions from other people, in order to solve more complex problems. 
										<br><br>
										Besides playing games with friends to have fun, I like playing football and table tennis as well. 
										Moreover, I love taking pictures with wonderful landscapes that catch my eye, they just offer me some peace of mind.
										Some of the images here are a small part of the photos I've been shooting in Finland (not the top one).

									<h3>Penguin - Unity ML<span style="float: right;font-size: 0.9em;">Unity / Python environment</span></h3>
									<h4>05/2020<span style="float: right;">C#</span></h4>
									<p>
										It's actually a <b><a href="https://bit.ly/3qHtmnG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a></b> that I followed to learn Unity Machine Learning.
										The author utilizes Reinforcement Learning to train the Penguin, making it find the fish and avoid bones, then feed the hungry baby.
										<br><br>
										Technically, the Penguin Agent needs to Observe, make a Decision then perform Action. Its goal is to maximize the Reward (both positive and negative) to complete the task right and as fast as possible. 
										<br><br>
										My attempt was letting the Penguin pick both fish and bones, but it has to bring them to the right place. The fish goes to the baby and the bones should be in a nearby trash bin.
										Unsurprisingly, the training was pretty much longer than it used to be, as it's hard for the Penguin to differentiate them; and it also accidentally touched the wrong one before reaching the right one.
										<br><br>
										Although I was not making this from scratch, it was great for me to learn some basic knowledge of Unity ML.
										It's also a useful and interesting experience to observe your "kid" getting smarter and better.
										In short, nothing goes wrong when studying Machine Learning, and I hope I can practically learn more of it.

									<p>
										An assignment in Level Design course, utilizing First Person Template in UE4. 
										The task is to lead players to a Victory destination, with colors, lights, and ready-made mechanics. 
										<br><br>
										As a Programmer, I tweaked it a little bit to offer some difficulties to the level. 
										I also took advanced of the built-in physics and control to create more challenges.
										The result may seem hard, but I believe it would make more sense if it's in a complete game.

										An assignment in Game Design course, in which the task is to replicate a very old game and "upgrade" it. 
										I found this <b><a href="https://bit.ly/39YEplM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a></b> on Retro Games page, which was made in 1977.
										It is a local multiplayer game that 2 players try to kill each other and compete who has more kills to win. 
										<br><br>
										The interesting mechanic for me is the ability to control the bullet while it's flying, although it's pretty hard and partly conflicting with the movement. 
										However, it makes the game really fun and also requires some skill to be able to defeat the opponent.
										Thus, I replicated it similarly, and also implemented "teleport" mechanic, that allows the tank to teleport to its bullet.
										<br><br>
										This is just a demo, no proper UI or sound, since I just developed it when I have freetime, until the deadline.
										However, a playtest was conducted, and I found most of testers were enjoyable when playing an old-school local multiplayer game against each other.
										I can feel the potential of this project and hopefully, I will able to continue developing this when the era of local multiplayer is back with new technologies, along with extra flavors.
